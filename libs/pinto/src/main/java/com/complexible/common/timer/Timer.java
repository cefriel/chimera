/**
 * <p>Class used to keep track how much time is spent for a specific operation. Timers are
 * primarily used to display info about performance. A timer is started at the beginning
 * of a function and is stopped at the end of that function (special care needed when
 * there are multiple return commands in a function because the status of unstopped timers
 * is undefined). A timer also stores how many times the timer has been started so average
 * time spent in a function can be computed.</p> 
 * 
 * <p>When a timer is used in a recursive function it will typically be started multiple times.
 * Timer class will only measure the time spent in the first call. This is done by counting 
 * how many times a timer is started and time spent is computed only when the number of 
 * stop() calls evens out the start() calls. It
 * is the programmer's responsibility to make sure each start() is
 * stopped by a stop() call.</p> 
 * 
 * <p>Each timer may be associated with a timeout limit. This means that time spent between 
 * start() and stop() calls should be less than the 
 * timeout specified. Timeouts will only be checked when check() function
 * is called. If check() function is not called setting timeouts has no
 * effect. It is up to the programmer to decide when and how many times a timer will be checked.</p> 
 * 
 * <p>There may be a dependency between timers. For example, classification, realization and entailment
 * operations all use consistency checks. If something goes wrong inside a consistency check and
 * that operation does not finish in a reasonable time, the timeout on the parent timer may 
 * expire. To handle such cases, a timer may be associated with a parent timer so every time
 * a timer is checked for a timeout,  its parent timer will also be checked. Normally, we would 
 * like to associate many parents with a timer but for efficiency reasons (looping over an array
 * each time is expensive) each timer is allowed to have only one parent. </p> 
 *  
 * <p>{@link Timers Timers} class stores a set of timers and provides functions to start, stop and
 * check timers.  </p>
