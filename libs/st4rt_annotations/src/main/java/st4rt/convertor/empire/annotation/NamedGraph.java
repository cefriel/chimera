/**
 * <p>Annotation for specifying the named graph instances of a Java object should be persisted to.  When
 * the type is {@link NamedGraph.NamedGraphType#Instance} the resulting RDF will be persisted to a graph whose
 * name is the same as the rdf:ID of the instance being saved.  When the type is {@link NamedGraph.NamedGraphType#Static}
 * you must also specify a value, and the specified URI value is what is used as the named graph uri during persistence.</p>
 * <p>
 * Usage:<br/>
 * <code><pre>
 * &#64;RdfClass("foaf:Person")
 * &#64;NamedGraph(type = NamedGraph.NamedGraphType.Instance)
 * public class Foo implements SupportsRdfId {
 *   ...
 * }
 * </pre></code>
